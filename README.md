# Unscented Kalman Filter 

In this project I have utilized Unscented kalman filter algorithm to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. The main goal of the project is to apply Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse data from LIDAR and Radar sensors of a self driving car using C++.

This project uses Implementation of UKF on a CTRV (Constant Turn Rate and Velocity) process model for object tracking. The UKF is a powerful technique for performing recursive nonlinear estimations. Compared to Extended Kalman filter, UKF uses a derivative-free approach. UKF is also more accurate than the Extended Kalman Filter and has an equivalent computational complexity.

Detailed explanation and the math behind UKF is explained [here](https://www.pdx.edu/biomedical-signal-processing-lab/sites/www.pdx.edu.biomedical-signal-processing-lab/files/ukf.wan_.chapt7_.pdf)

## Contents of this Repository

* `src` - Directory for project source code
   * `main.cpp` - Entry point for the Unscented Kalman Filter reads in data, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function                   to calculate RMSE.
   * `UKF.cpp` - Defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar. Initializes the filter,                  calls the predict function, calls the update function.

## How to run the code

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it by either of the following commands: 
   * `./UnscentedKF ../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt`

## Kalman filter general steps and data flow

All Kalman filters have three steps 

1. Initialization
2. Prediction
3. Update

A standard Kalman filter can only handle linear equations. Both the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) allows you to use non-linear equations. The difference between EKF and UKF is how they handle non-linear equations. Extended Kalman Filter uses the Jacobian matrix to linearize non-linear functions. Unscented Kalman Filter on the other hand, does not need to linearize non-linear functions, instead the unscented Kalman filter takes representative points from a Gaussian distribution.


# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project utilize an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/ukf.cpp, src/ukf.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurment that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF` Previous versions use i/o from text files.  The current state uses i/o
from the simulator.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
